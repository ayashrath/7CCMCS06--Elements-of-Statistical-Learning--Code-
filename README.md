# Code for Module 7CCMCS06: Elements of Statistical Learning

This is just a code dump where I shall make and use code to better understand stuff for my module. The code will primarily be in Python, but if I have time I might add same functioning code in Julia (a language I am currently learning on the side).

## Note

The code has not been created by AI, but have used AI (Gemini) like a search engine to get help every so often.
